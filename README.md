# Using GPT-3.5turbo with Local Document Embeddings to Search Your Data

This is a new example for a second edition of my Swift AI book which you can read for free online: [https://leanpub.com/SwiftAI/read](https://leanpub.com/SwiftAI/read), or you can purcahse a copy to support my writing.

Run the demo using:

    swift main.swift

Note that we only use standard libraries in this example so no Package.swift file is required.
